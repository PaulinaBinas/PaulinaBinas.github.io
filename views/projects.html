            <h3>VR Interior Visualization</h3>
            <div>
                <span class="bold">Description: </span>
                Application prepared for my diploma thesis, that was inspired by the problems my father (stained-glass artist) faces
                in his job, when designing windows for clients. The software allows its user to enter a virtual interior and 
                visualize a room by choosing its type, the furniture and the stained-glass window. Once inside the visualized room, 
                one is also given the possibility to manipulate interior and exterior lighting, to observe how its changes might 
                affect the colored-shadows cast by the window.

            <h3>Android Application for students of heavy-machinery course</h3>
            <div>
                <span class="bold">Description: </span>
                This application was developed for a university course, but was the idea of the training company owner.
                It is a company based in Wrocław, Poland, thus the language of the application is Polish. 
                The team who developed it consisted of four people, including me, with each one of us being different nationality.
                We have improved not only our programming skills during this project, but also communication and collaboration,
                which are equally important when working with other people.
